## Using electron Tray module

See how the Tray class is imported and used to create a tray application

The BrowserWindow width, height and positions values should be chosen very carefully.

BrowserWindow should be a frameless window sticked to particular location

This also shows how to implement a menu in a BrowserWindow depicting similar rendering style that of native applications

Thanking you
